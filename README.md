# ðŸ›’ Product Store

A simple full-stack **CRUD web application** built with **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. This app allows users to create, read, update, and delete products. Weâ€™ve used **Zustand** for state management and **Chakra UI** for beautiful UI components.

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
  â†’ Created REST APIs to **Create, Read, Update, Delete** products and store data in MongoDB.

- **Frontend**: React.js with Chakra UI  
  â†’ Built UI with Chakra components. Used **Zustand** for global state management to update UI when users interact (add, update, delete products).

- **Routing**: React Router DOM  
  â†’ Implemented client-side routing between HomePage (to fetch products) and CreatePage (to add new product).
